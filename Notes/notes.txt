Entity Framework
	code first, model first
	use iCollection when describing the parent
	use class name when describing the child
	they are singular - returns an instance of a record

	NotMapped - ids that the property in your entity doesn't have a corresponding column in the database 

DbSet - refers to your entity

in eRestaurant: 
	Reservations which are linked to tables (many to many relationship)

	use 'protected override void OnModeICreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)'


DO IN THIS ORDER!!!
	-Create Class Library in solution
	-Create BLL, DAL, Entities folders in class library
	-Create DTOs, POCOs subfolders in Entities
	-Make sure you have reference to System.Data.Entity and System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations in Class 	-Library (Add -> Reference)
	-Create Class in Entities
	-In class, before namespace add 
		#region Additional Namespaces
		using System.Data.Entity;
		using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
		#endregion
	- make class public
	- in class, add
		[Key]
		table variables with {get; set;}

		public virtual (ICollection<class>/classname<> {get;set;}
	- add corresponding class

BLL is where all sercurity is -everyone has to go through the BLL before they can get to DAL

BLL must be public in order for web pages to access it.
